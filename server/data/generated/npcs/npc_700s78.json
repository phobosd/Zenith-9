  "description": "Suture's face is a canvas of old burns and new scars, punctuated by a single, multi-spectrum optical implant that hums faintly. A worn, grease-stained lab coat, haphazardly patched with mismatched tech fabric, covers their gaunt frame, hinting at a life spent in the shadows. Their presence is a quiet hum of weary competence, always observing, always calculating.",

Their illicit medical expertise is crucial for those suffering from the physical ravages of the leaking Matrix or the brutal realities of street life, ensuring the downtrodden have a place to mend when official channels fail and corporate surveillance makes legitimate care dangerous."
