  "description": "A pulsating mass of bioluminescent tissue trails along the floor, its tentacles twitching and coiling in anticipation. The neon light it emits shimmers with an unnatural intensity, casting eerie shadows across the walls. Its central body is a bulbous sack that seems to expand and contract rhythmically.",
