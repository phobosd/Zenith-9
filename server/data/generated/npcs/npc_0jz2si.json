  "description": "His face is a patchwork of scarred flesh and cheap, chrome plating around his jaw, suggesting a past altercation. He wears a heavy, oil-stained synth-leather jacket over frayed combat fatigues, giving him a perpetually hunched, menacing silhouette. A single, flickering red optic implant replaces his left eye, constantly scanning his surroundings with a paranoid twitch.",

They prey on those disoriented by the leaks or scavenge unstable tech."
