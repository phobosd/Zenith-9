  "description": "The Photogorgon resembles a bloated rat, its fur matted and pulsing with electric neon blue light. Its most striking feature are the multifaceted optical implants that dominate its face, glowing with an eerie violet hue as they scan their surroundings. These optics allow it to see in infrared, ultraviolet, and even through solid matter.",

However, a virus mutated them into these techno-organic horrors, granting them sentience and an insatiable hunger for organic matter, including humans. They now infest the sewers and dark alleys of the city, using their advanced optics to hunt prey."
