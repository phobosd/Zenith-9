  "description": "The Armored Tentacle Siphon is a grotesque fusion of vermin and cybernetics. Its body resembles that of an oversized rat, but its back is covered in thick metallic plates fused with pulsating bio-tissue. Eight long, prehensile tentacles sprout from its shoulders, each tipped with razor-sharp barbs.",
