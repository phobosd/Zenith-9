  "description": "Glimmercap Jax is a stooped figure, his pale, translucent skin often showing faint, bioluminescent fungal patches. His right eye is a complex, multi-lensed optical implant that pulses with a soft, internal glow, while a delicate network of mycelial tendrils occasionally twitches from the corner of his left, organic eye.",
