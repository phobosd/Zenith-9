| **Apex Fungal** | 1250 | 144 | 36 | aggressive | A towering behemoth of pulsing, iridescent fungal growth, the Apex Fungal dominates the cityscape. Its form is vaguely humanoid, but warped and twisted by a grotesque array of symbiotic fungi that coat its body in bioluminescent patterns. Two colossal fangs protrude from its lower jaw, dripping with an acidic ichor. The air around it shimmers with spores, choking anyone who dares to approach. |
| **Apex-Armored** | 90 | 134 | 40 | aggressive | A colossal figure clad in shimmering plates of armor that seem to shift and writhe with an internal energy.

Eight long, prehensile tentacles sprout from its shoulders, each tipped with razor-sharp barbs. |
| **Black ICE** | 200 | 50 | 10 | aggressive | A dark, swirling vortex of malevolent code. It is an aggressive intrusion countermeasure designed to physically damage the brain of any hacker it encounters. |
| **Chrome-Jack** | 200 | 60 | 18 | Neutral | A grizzled street doc with chrome eyes and a network of scars crisscrossing his face, Chrome-Jack wears patched leather gloves over thick cybernetic fingers.

He has a weary look about him, and speaks with quiet authority. |
| **Chrome-Whisper** | 235 | 62 | 18 | cautious | A grizzled street doc with cybernetic enhancements grafted into her face and arms, she wears patched fatigues over reinforced leggings. Her movements are slow but deliberate, giving off an air of weary professionalism. She has a fondness for black coffee and the scent of burning oil. |
| **Chromeclaw** | 250 | 70 | 18 | aggressive | A hulking brute built for street brawls, Chromeclaw's augmented limbs are scarred from countless fights in the underbelly of Neo-Shanghai. His worn leather jacket hangs loose over his cybernetic chestplate, and a permanent sneer twists his lips as he scans for marks. |
| **Corvus Null** | 235 | 67 | 20 | Cautious | His chrome is old and mismatched - a patched-up eye socket, corroded finger claws, and the faint blue glow of a neural implant behind his ear. He wears a worn leather jacket over a threadbare hoodie with ripped jeans held up by heavy chains. His eyes dart around nervously, constantly scanning for threats. |
| **Cyber Thug** | 50 | 10 | 5 | aggressive | A lean, dangerous figure leaning with practiced nonchalance. They wear a patchwork of scavenged leather and matte-black synthetic plates. A glowing red cybernetic implant replaces their left eye, scanning you with mechanical precision, while their right hand hovers near a holster.

| **Echo Static** | 300 | 75 | 20 | elusive | A hunched figure draped in layers of patched-up clothing, Echo's chrome is subtle but extensive - a neural implant glinting beneath his fringe, a modified optical lens over one eye, and wires snaking under the collar of his jacket. His gaze flickers between screens as he types furiously, fingers flying across the keys like spiders on glass. |
| **Giant Rat** | 20 | 5 | 0 | aggressive | A massive, mutated rodent the size of a large dog. Its fur is matted and greasy, patchy in places where scarred, pink skin shows through.

| **Glimmercap Jax** | 180 | 20 | 8 | cautious | Glimmercap Jax is a stooped figure, his pale, translucent skin often showing faint, bioluminescent fungal patches. His right eye is a complex, multi-lensed optical implant that pulses with a soft, internal glow, while a delicate network of mycelial tendrils occasionally twitches from the corner of his left, organic eye. |
| **Grit-Tooth** | 195 | 62 | 16 | cautious | His face is a patchwork of scarred flesh and cheap, chrome plating around his jaw, suggesting a past altercation. He wears a heavy, oil-stained synth-leather jacket over frayed combat fatigues, giving him a perpetually hunched, menacing silhouette. A single, flickering red optic implant replaces his left eye, constantly scanning his surroundings with a paranoid twitch. |

| **Sloane Vane** | 250 | 60 | 20 | Cautious | Vane is a wiry figure perpetually hunched over a battered datapad, her fingers flying across the keys. Her chrome eye glints in the neon light, mismatched against her shaved head and faded leather jacket. She emits an aura of quiet intensity, like she's always on the verge of discovering something important. |
| **Spark-Optics** | 230 | 65 | 17 | aggressive | These rat-like creatures are covered in twitching, bioluminescent optic nerves that flare and crackle when agitated. Their eyes have been replaced with crude cybernetic implants capable of emitting blinding flashes of light. |
| **Sparkling Volatiles** | 215 | 70 | 20 | aggressive | These creatures are small and vaguely rodent-like, their bodies warped into unnatural shapes by volatile techno-organic mutations.

A worn, grease-stained lab coat, haphazardly patched with mismatched tech fabric, covers their gaunt frame, hinting at a life spent in the shadows. Their presence is a quiet hum of weary competence, always observing, always calculating. |
| **Tentacle Burst** | 95 | 63 | 16 | aggressive | A bloated, pulsating mass of organic tissue covered in oily slime and pulsing veins, the Tentacle Burst resembles a grotesque jellyfish fused with an armored cockroach. From its back sprout dozens of razor-sharp tentacles that twitch constantly, seeking anything to latch onto. |
| **The Conduit** | 865 | 136 | 40 | aggressive | A towering mass of interwoven cables and circuitry pulses with malevolent energy, writhing like living veins beneath a blackened carapace.
